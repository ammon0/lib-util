# Doxyfile 1.8.11

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "Lib-Util"

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer a
# quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          = "A Utility C Library"

# If the JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then doxygen will interpret the
# first line (until the first dot) of a Javadoc-style comment as the brief
# description. If set to NO, the Javadoc-style will behave just like regular Qt-
# style comments (thus requiring an explicit @brief command for a brief
# description.)
# The default value is: NO.

JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF      = YES

# Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C tag to YES if your project consists of C sources
# only.

OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C  = YES

# If you use STL classes (i.e. std::string, std::vector, etc.) but do not want
# to include (a tag file for) the STL sources as input, then you should set this
# tag to YES in order to let doxygen match functions declarations and
# definitions whose arguments contain STL classes (e.g. func(std::string);
# versus func(std::string) {}). This also make the inheritance and collaboration
# diagrams that involve STL classes more complete and accurate.
# The default value is: NO.

BUILTIN_STL_SUPPORT    = NO

# When the INLINE_SIMPLE_STRUCTS tag is set to YES, structs, classes, and unions
# with only public data fields or simple typedef fields will be shown inline in
# the documentation of the scope in which they are defined (i.e. file,
# namespace, or group documentation), provided this scope is documented. If set
# to NO, structs, classes, and unions are shown on a separate page (for HTML and
# Man pages) or section (for LaTeX and RTF).
# The default value is: NO.

INLINE_SIMPLE_STRUCTS  = YES

# When TYPEDEF_HIDES_STRUCT tag is enabled, a typedef of a struct, union, or
# enum is documented as struct, union, or enum with the name of the typedef. So
# typedef struct TypeS {} TypeT, will appear in the documentation as a struct
# with name TypeT. When disabled the typedef will appear as a member of a file,
# namespace, or class. And the struct will be named TypeS. This can typically be
# useful for C code in case the coding convention dictates that all compound
# types are typedef'ed and only the typedef is referenced, never the tag name.
# The default value is: NO.

TYPEDEF_HIDES_STRUCT   = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Build related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXTRACT_STATIC = YES
GENERATE_DEPRECATEDLIST= YES

# The FILE_VERSION_FILTER tag can be used to specify a program or script that
# doxygen should invoke to get the current version for each file (typically from
# the version control system). Doxygen will invoke the program by executing (via
# popen()) the command command input-file, where command is the value of the
# FILE_VERSION_FILTER tag, and input-file is the name of an input file provided
# by doxygen. Whatever the program writes to standard output is used as the file
# version. For an example see the documentation.

FILE_VERSION_FILTER    =

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to warning and progress messages
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The QUIET tag can be used to turn on/off the messages that are generated to
# standard output by doxygen. If QUIET is set to YES this implies that the
# messages are off.
# The default value is: NO.

QUIET                  = YES

# This WARN_NO_PARAMDOC option can be enabled to get warnings for functions that
# are documented, but have no documentation for their parameters or return
# value. If set to NO, doxygen will only warn about wrong or incomplete
# parameter documentation, but not about the absence of documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

WARN_NO_PARAMDOC       = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces. See also FILE_PATTERNS and EXTENSION_MAPPING
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

INPUT                  = README.md ./util/
EXCLUDE                =
USE_MDFILE_AS_MAINPAGE = README.md

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the
# FILE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard patterns (like *.cpp and
# *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories.
#
# Note that for custom extensions or not directly supported extensions you also
# need to set EXTENSION_MAPPING for the extension otherwise the files are not
# read by doxygen.
#
# If left blank the following patterns are tested:*.c, *.cc, *.cxx, *.cpp,
# *.c++, *.java, *.ii, *.ixx, *.ipp, *.i++, *.inl, *.idl, *.ddl, *.odl, *.h,
# *.hh, *.hxx, *.hpp, *.h++, *.cs, *.d, *.php, *.php4, *.php5, *.phtml, *.inc,
# *.m, *.markdown, *.md, *.mm, *.dox, *.py, *.pyw, *.f90, *.f, *.for, *.tcl,
# *.vhd, *.vhdl, *.ucf, *.qsf, *.as and *.js.

FILE_PATTERNS          =
EXCLUDE_PATTERNS       =

# The RECURSIVE tag can be used to specify whether or not subdirectories should
# be searched for input files as well.
# The default value is: NO.

RECURSIVE              = NO

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the HTML output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The HTML_OUTPUT tag is used to specify where the HTML docs will be put. If a
# relative path is entered the value of OUTPUT_DIRECTORY will be put in front of
# it.
# The default directory is: html.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_OUTPUT            = docs



# If the HTML_DYNAMIC_SECTIONS tag is set to YES then the generated HTML
# documentation will contain sections that can be hidden and shown after the
# page has loaded.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_DYNAMIC_SECTIONS  = NO

# The GENERATE_TREEVIEW tag is used to specify whether a tree-like index
# structure should be generated to display hierarchical information. If the tag
# value is set to YES, a side panel will be generated containing a tree-like
# index structure (just like the one that is generated for HTML Help). For this
# to work a browser that supports JavaScript, DHTML, CSS and frames is required
# (i.e. any modern browser). Windows users are probably better off using the
# HTML help feature. Via custom style sheets (see HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET) one can
# further fine-tune the look of the index. As an example, the default style
# sheet generated by doxygen has an example that shows how to put an image at
# the root of the tree instead of the PROJECT_NAME. Since the tree basically has
# the same information as the tab index, you could consider setting
# DISABLE_INDEX to YES when enabling this option.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = NO

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the man page output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_MAN tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate man pages for
# classes and files.
# The default value is: NO.

GENERATE_MAN           = NO

# The MAN_OUTPUT tag is used to specify where the man pages will be put. If a
# relative path is entered the value of OUTPUT_DIRECTORY will be put in front of
# it. A directory man3 will be created inside the directory specified by
# MAN_OUTPUT.
# The default directory is: man.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_MAN is set to YES.

MAN_OUTPUT             = man

# The MAN_EXTENSION tag determines the extension that is added to the generated
# man pages. In case the manual section does not start with a number, the number
# 3 is prepended. The dot (.) at the beginning of the MAN_EXTENSION tag is
# optional.
# The default value is: .3.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_MAN is set to YES.

MAN_EXTENSION          = .3

# The MAN_SUBDIR tag determines the name of the directory created within
# MAN_OUTPUT in which the man pages are placed. If defaults to man followed by
# MAN_EXTENSION with the initial . removed.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_MAN is set to YES.

MAN_SUBDIR             =

# If the MAN_LINKS tag is set to YES and doxygen generates man output, then it
# will generate one additional man file for each entity documented in the real
# man page(s). These additional files only source the real man page, but without
# them the man command would be unable to find the correct page.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_MAN is set to YES.

MAN_LINKS              = NO

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the preprocessor
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The INCLUDE_PATH tag can be used to specify one or more directories that
# contain include files that are not input files but should be processed by the
# preprocessor.
# This tag requires that the tag SEARCH_INCLUDES is set to YES.

INCLUDE_PATH           =

ENABLE_PREPROCESSING   = YES
MACRO_EXPANSION        = YES
EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF     = YES

# The PREDEFINED tag can be used to specify one or more macro names that are
# defined before the preprocessor is started (similar to the -D option of e.g.
# gcc). The argument of the tag is a list of macros of the form: name or
# name=definition (no spaces). If the definition and the "=" are omitted, "=1"
# is assumed. To prevent a macro definition from being undefined via #undef or
# recursively expanded use the := operator instead of the = operator.
# This tag requires that the tag ENABLE_PREPROCESSING is set to YES.

PREDEFINED             = __attribute__((x))= BUF_SZ ()=

# If the SKIP_FUNCTION_MACROS tag is set to YES then doxygen's preprocessor will
# remove all references to function-like macros that are alone on a line, have
# an all uppercase name, and do not end with a semicolon. Such function macros
# are typically used for boiler-plate code, and will confuse the parser if not
# removed.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag ENABLE_PREPROCESSING is set to YES.

SKIP_FUNCTION_MACROS   = YES

GENERATE_LATEX = NO
HAVE_DOT       = NO
